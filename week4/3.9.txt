3.9 Any operation that changes the underlying array in a Vector
invalidates all of the iterators for that vector because the
iterators are wrappers around a pointer to an object in the internal
array representation of the vector. If the internal representation
changes, there is no guarantee that the iterators for the pre-change
representation will behave logically on the post-change array. Especially
in cases where the change prompts and array resize.
